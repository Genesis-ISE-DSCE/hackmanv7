## About

**HACKMAN** <br />
**From bits to bytes, code your way to new heights.** <br />
**Date : June 4th - 5th**



HACKMAN v.7 is an inter-college, extravagant 24-hour Hackathon hosted by the Department of ISE at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE), Bangalore. We give the brightest minds a chance to brainstorm as a team and come up with unique solutions, code them out, and solve some of society's pressing problems. Over the first six versions, we have seen some brilliant projects, and we challenge you to top them with your out-of-the-box ideas.


**“You can't solve a problem on the same level that it was created. You have to rise above it to the next level.”**
